## background
#### Air quality classification
The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change that was adopted by 196 Parties at COP21 in Paris. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.  
To reach this long-term temperature goal, countries aim to peak greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate-neutral planet by mid-century.  
That is why the European Union is allocating large amounts of resources to the development of new technologies that allow the improvement of the fight against pollution. One of these is a new type of sensor based on laser technology that allows air quality to be detected based on different sensors.
***
## problem
The objective is to carry out a predictive model that allows knowing the type of air quality based on the measurements of the sensors.  
0 corresponds to Good air quality  
1 corresponds to Moderate air quality  
2 corresponds to Dangerous air quality
